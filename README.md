# Ruby on Rails Playground

This is a sample Ruby on Rails application.  It has been a while since I wrote a Rails application and I wanted to get some experience using the latest versions of Ruby and Rails.

This sample application has three basic models:

 * Artists
 * Albums
 * Songs

It uses the Spotify API to seed these basic models.

This site is [hosted on Heroku](https://stark-citadel-5574.herokuapp.com/) (the free version with limited resources).  You can try it out to add a new artist or play a song (requires Spotify to be installed) through the Rails website.
